README

For now this directory contains tests for all of the modules. To avoid confusion
each test filename looks like test_MODULE.py or test_MODULE_SOMETHING.py. For 
example:
    test_cfl_counts.py
    test_cfn.py

The tests are designed to be run with nose. Running `nosetests` in this 
directory or executing runtests.sh in the parent directory will run all tests.
