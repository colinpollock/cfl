* Write function to convert grammar to CNF.

* CFLGenerator.__str__

* Optionally pass a separator to CFLGenerator.generate that would be inserted
  between terminals.

* Currently the generator's definition of length is the number of nonterminals.
  It would be good to add the option for "length" to mean the number of 
  characters.

* Write tests for:
  *  the preprocessing of CFLGenerator
  *  Check randomness of generated strings.

* Move tests into subdirectory. Use script to call them from main dir.

* Gracefully handle the cases where string of requestedlength cannot be 
  generated.

* Add option to generate() to allow different lengths to be specified. Maybe
  allow a container to be passed as the length?

* Use a profiler, maybe code parts in C.
  
* Use NLTK's probabilistic CF rules?

* Split some projects off. Add some subdirs for tests, individual projects, 
  etc..
