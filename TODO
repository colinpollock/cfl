* Write function to convert grammar to CNF.

* Currently the generator's definition of length is the number of nonterminals.
  It would be good to add the option for "length" to mean the number of 
  characters. Actually this is dumb. Remove?

* Put try/except in main() to handle GenerationFailure. 

* Write tests for:
  *  the preprocessing of CFLGenerator
  *  Check randomness of generated strings.

* Move tests into subdirectory. Use script to call them from main dir.

* Gracefully handle the cases where string of requestedlength cannot be 
  generated.

* Add option to generate() to allow different lengths to be specified. Maybe
  allow a container to be passed as the length?

* Use a profiler, maybe code parts in C.
  
* Use NLTK's probabilistic CF rules?

* Split some projects off. Add some subdirs for tests, individual projects, 
  etc..

* Implement the O(n) time generation algorithm from Mairson 1995. See if the
  extra preprocessing time is worth it.
